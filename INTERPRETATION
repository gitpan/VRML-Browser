My own VRML97 spec interpretations -- please feel free to challenge.

1. PROTOs and ROUTEs and SCRIPTs.
 - SCRIPTs see the outer interface of the proto even when doing
   direct access, not the inside

2. TouchSensor
 - isOver events are not generated when the user doesn't move the mouse.
   if the user moves the mouse, the endpoint is compared with the current
   isOver status and if it's different, an event is generated.
