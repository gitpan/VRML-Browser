- fix bindable nodes' loading so that the correct nodes get bound..
- use timestamps for changes in nodes, for use with event routes
  and display lists
- multithreading: load & execute?
- raycasting interface for VRMLC so that we get normals & hitpoints
  & texcoords for touchsensor & are able to implement other sensors.
- binding nodes properly (was already done once but the event revamp
  undid it
- timesensor should ignore events when active.
