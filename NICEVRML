VRML syntax relaxation for preprocessor:
(currently only the route thing is implemented)

The intent is to understand many things but warn of non-standard
things. 

ROUTE aaa.bbb to ccc.ddd     [allow lowercase as well as omission of TO]
Transform {
	translate 0 0 0      [allow 'translate, rotate' for translation..]
	Shape {		     [automatically infer 'children' for uppercase]
		Cone { }     [automatically infer 'geometry' for suitable]
		Material { ... } [...]
	}
}
