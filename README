Welcome to a developer-alpha release of VRML::Browser.

Currently, only simple things are implemented - however, my hope
is that I have implemented enough simple things so that adding
the complicated things will not be too much work after this.

See the file INSTALL for how to compile this program.

After installation, try

	./browse tests/1.wrl

(the file browse is the perl script which starts the browser -- if
there is a problem ("file not found"), try

	perl browse tests/1.wrl

or change the first line of "browse" to find your perl binary).

This should open a new window with a view of the VRML world in question.

Use the first and third button of your mouse (while moving your mouse)
to move around.

To change viewers between walk and examine, press 'w' or 'e' in 
the browser window.

E-mail any comments, questions & patches to me at lukka@fas.harvard.edu
