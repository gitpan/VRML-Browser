To install, you need Perl 5.004_04 or later as well as an OpenGL-
compatible library (e.g. IRIX native opengl or the freely available
Mesa library). You also need an ANSI C compiler and the X development
libraries as well as an X server to run this program with.

First, edit OpenGL/Makefile.PL to explain where your OpenGL libraries
are - the current settings are for finding the Mesa library in my
home directory so you will probably want to change that. Change -lMesaGL
to -lGL if you have native OpenGL.

Next, try 

	perl Makefile.PL

in the main VRML::Browser directory. If there are any errors, correct
them first. Email me if the problem persists.

Then, just say 

	make

which should compile and install (in the blib/ directory) the files.
Because this release is strictly alpha, installing them anywhere else
is not advisable.
